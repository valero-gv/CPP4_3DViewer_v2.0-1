# CPP4_3DViewer_v2.0-1

Description:
Development of a graphical application for loading, rendering and manipulating 3D models in .obj format. The application allows you to rotate, scale, and move 3D objects, as well as apply different types of projections.

Technologies:
C, OpenGL – for rendering 3D models
QT – for the graphical interface (if used)
Transformation matrices, rendering algorithms

My role:
Developed a parser .obj files for the correct display of models.
Implemented functions for rotating, zooming, and moving objects.
Developed support for central and parallel projections.
Optimized algorithms for working with vertices for smooth animation.

Result:
A full-fledged 3D viewer program has been created that allows you to download and manipulate .obj models with basic graphical transformation.
